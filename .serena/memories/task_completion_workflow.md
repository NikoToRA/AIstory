# Task Completion Workflow

## What to Do When a Task is Completed

### ⚠️ No Formal Testing Infrastructure
The AIstory project currently **does not have** standard linting, testing, or formatting commands set up. This is important to note for development workflow.

### Current Task Completion Steps

1. **Manual Verification**
   - Run the relevant Python script to test functionality
   - Check output files in `story-world/` directories
   - Verify GitHub Actions workflow if applicable

2. **File Integrity Checks**
   ```bash
   # Check if Python files have syntax errors
   python3 -m py_compile haconiwa.py
   python3 -m py_compile [modified_file].py
   
   # Verify JSON files are valid
   python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('story-world/characters/chappie/memory.json'))"
   ```

3. **Git Operations**
   ```bash
   git status
   git add .
   git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
   # Note: Only push if explicitly requested by user
   ```

### Recommended Future Improvements
The project would benefit from:
- **Linting**: `flake8`, `pylint`, or `black` for Python code formatting
- **Testing**: `pytest` for unit tests
- **Type checking**: `mypy` for static type analysis
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Automated checks before commits

### Current Quality Assurance
- Manual testing of Python scripts
- Visual inspection of generated stories and character responses
- GitHub Actions automated workflow validation
- Character memory and relationship consistency checks

### Special Considerations
- **Japanese content**: Ensure UTF-8 encoding is maintained
- **Character consistency**: Verify character personalities remain consistent
- **Story continuity**: Check that new stories build on existing character memories
- **GitHub integration**: Test that Issues trigger proper AI responses
